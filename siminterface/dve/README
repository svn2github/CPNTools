   This sml files provide structures to translate a dve file into an
sml structure implementing the MODEL signature and some other
structures (hash function, serializer).  DVE is the language of the
Divine tool.  A description of the language may be found at
http://divine.fi.muni.cz/page.php?page=language
A database of models described in this language may be found at
http://anna.fi.muni.cz/models/?page=models-list

To do:
- bit handling operators ~, <<, >>, ... are not very well supported
- better management of types.  currently types byte and int are both mapped
  to int

Notes:
- the implementation does not currently benefit from the locality principle
- We made some assumptions and slight changes to the language.  These are
  listed below.
  + a process may have a local variable and a state with the same name
  + arrays cannot be transmitted through channels
  + arrays are not valid expressions, e.g., this will be rejected:
    effect myArray = myOtherArray;
  + global variables, channels and processes may defined in any order
  + global elements, i.e., global variables, channels or processes, may
    be referenced in processes even if they have'nt been declared yet
- Thease features are currently not supported
  + synchronous systems
  + commited states
  + accepting states
  + buffered channels
  + assertions
  + typed channels

Bugs:
- the model of pgm_protocol.3.dve (# of states is different than the
  one reported on the BEEM webpage) is not generated correctly
