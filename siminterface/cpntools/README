The files cpn-event-sig.sml, cpn-state-sig.sml, and cpntools-model.sml
should be loaded as part of the SS-tool.  They do not depend on the
CPN simulator.  These files generate two interfaces, CPN'EVENT and
CPN'STATE, which describes the events resp. states of a CPN model, and
a functor CPNToolsModel, which can generate a MODEL from a CPN'STATE
and a CPN'EVENT.

The files net-capture.sml, cpn-event.sml, and cpn-state.sml should be
loaded after the CPN simulator.  These files wille define a structure
NetCapture, which is able to capture the internal structure of a CPN
net from the CPN simulator.  CPN'State and CPN'Event are able to
generate code for structures Mark, Bind, CPNToolsState and
CPNToolsEvent, the two latter implementing CPN'STATE and CPN'EVENT.

The file switch.sml should be loaded after the model is loaded into
the CPN simulator, and immediately before the SS analysis.  This will
instantiate the CPNToolsModel functor into a CPNToolsModel structure
using CPNToolsState and CPNToolsEvent.  CPNToolsModel will implement
MODEL.
