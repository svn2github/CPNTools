This CPN simulator is taken from the cpn2000 repository from the darwin
branch.  The simulator compiles on SML/NJ 110.59.

The rmi and comms libraries are taken from the BRITNeY repository.  The
compiler patch in patch is also taken from the BRITNeY repository.

Run the makefile to build an image.  It will first load comms and rmi,
then the entore state-space tool, and finally the simulator.  In order to
build a patched version of SML/NJ must be used.  Check the HOWTO in patch
for more information (currently Mac only).
